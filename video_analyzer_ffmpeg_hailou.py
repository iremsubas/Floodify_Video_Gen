Generate a highly detailed, photorealistic video sequence for a video generation model with director controls, based on this {segment_duration}-second segment (from {start:.2f}s to {end:.2f}s).

For each distinct shot within this segment, provide a precise timeline entry using the format:
[Start Time]-[End Time]: [Camera Movement(s), Shot Type] [Detailed description of action, subjects, and environment, including visual style and lighting]

**Key Directives for Hailou Model:**

* **Camera Movements:** Use up to three explicit camera movement commands in square brackets for each shot. Choose from:
    * `[Pan left]` / `[Pan right]` (camera pivots horizontally)
    * `[Tilt up]` / `[Tilt down]` (camera pivots vertically)
    * `[Zoom in]` / `[Zoom out]` (focal length change)
    * `[Truck left]` / `[Truck right]` (camera moves horizontally, parallel to subject)
    * `[Push in]` / `[Pull out]` (camera moves closer/further from subject)
    * `[Pedestal up]` / `[Pedestal down]` (camera moves vertically)
    * `[Tracking shot]` (camera follows a moving subject)
    * `[Static shot]` (camera remains stationary)
    * `[Cut]` (indicates a sharp transition to a new shot)
    * `[Shake]` (simulates handheld camera instability)
* **Shot Types:** Specify classic shot types like `Wide shot`, `Medium shot`, `Close-up`, `Extreme close-up`, `Aerial shot`, `Over-the-shoulder`, `Point-of-view (POV)`.
* **Detail and Specificity:**
    * Describe *exactly* what is visible and what is happening.
    * Include **specific actions** and **movements** of subjects.
    * Detail the **environment and setting** (e.g., "lush green forest," "desert with red rock formations," "bustling city street at night").
    * Mention **landmarks** if present (e.g., "Eiffel Tower in the background," "Christ the Redeemer statue").
    * Clearly indicate **scene changes or transitions** within the segment.
    * Specify **lighting and atmosphere**: "golden hour," "dramatic backlighting," "soft, diffused light," "neon reflections," "overcast sky."
    * Include **visual style elements** if applicable, e.g., "cinematic," "photorealistic," "dreamy," "gritty."
* **Exclusions:** Do NOT mention clothing, appearance, or physical looks of subjects. Focus solely on their actions and the visual scene.
* **Conciseness:** Each shot description should be 1-2 concise, impactful sentences, packed with visual information.

**Example Timeline Entries:**

0â€“2s: [Wide shot, Pan left] A helicopter cockpit with a pilot speaking into a headset, city skyline visible through the window, illuminated by the warm glow of sunset.
2â€“4s: [Cut, Aerial shot, Zoom in] Camera flies over lush green mountains, revealing the Christ the Redeemer statue atop a peak under a clear blue sky, casting a long shadow.
4â€“6s: [Tracking shot, Pedestal up] Camera circles the statue, city and ocean in the background, with the sunlight glinting off the statue's surface."""
